Get a Handle on Handly. Step Zero
=================================

This is the first of submodule repositories that host source code
for a particular step of the running example of the article
[Get a Handle on Handly](https://github.com/pisv/gethandly/wiki).

Each subsequent step takes the source code of the preceding step and
adds some more functionality. In that way, you can always checkout
example plug-in projects from the repository corresponding to the previous
step and use them as a basis for further development in accordance with
the tutorial's instructions for the current step.

See [Step Zero](https://github.com/pisv/gethandly/wiki/Step-Zero)
of the article for information on setting up the development environment
for the example.
